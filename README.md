>As the years go by, the number of people who have pets is increasing. If you don't go far and just look at the people around you, you can see many people have pets.  
  
>We aim to provide pet owners with a better understanding of their behavior and needs.
Our application will allow pet owners to monitor their pets in real time, providing valuable insights into their daily activities and behaviors.
